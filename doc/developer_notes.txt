Problems:
    When I initially tried to run the app, and in fact sample apps, in Tomcat, 
    the browser got a 404 when it tried to access the endpoint. To fix this:
    - Ensure the maven websocket dependency matches the ws version associated
      with the Tomcat version (https://tomcat.apache.org/whichversion.html).
    - Set <scope>provided</scope> in the maven dep.
